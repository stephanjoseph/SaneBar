## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: **security@sanebar.com** (or create a private security advisory on GitHub if available).

Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fixes (optional)

You should receive a response within 48 hours. We'll work with you to understand and address the issue.

## Security Model

SaneBar is a **menu bar utility** that:

1. **Requires Accessibility permissions** to read and manipulate menu bar items
2. **Stores settings locally** in `~/Library/Application Support/SaneBar/`
3. **Makes zero network requests** — no analytics, telemetry, or updates phoning home (Sparkle update checks are user-initiated)

### Known Limitations

#### Touch ID / Password Protection

The "Require Authentication to Reveal Hidden Icons" feature is designed as a **casual privacy feature**, not a security boundary.

**What it protects against:**
- Casual snooping (someone glancing at your screen)
- Accidental reveals

**What it does NOT protect against:**
- Determined attackers with local access
- Users who can edit `~/Library/Application Support/SaneBar/settings.json`

The authentication flag is stored in a plaintext JSON file. An attacker with filesystem access could disable it. This is documented in [CODE_REVIEW.md](CODE_REVIEW.md).

**Remediation considered:** Moving the lock state to the System Keychain. Not implemented due to complexity vs. actual threat model for a menu bar organizer.

#### WiFi Network Names

SaneBar stores WiFi network names (SSIDs) in plaintext for the "Show on specific networks" trigger feature. This is stored locally and not transmitted anywhere.

## Security Audit

An independent code review was conducted in January 2026. Key findings:

| Finding | Severity | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Auth bypass via config file | Medium | Documented (see above) |
| Plaintext SSID storage | Low | Accepted (local only) |
| Force casts in AX code | Low | Tracked for fix |

Full report: [CODE_REVIEW.md](CODE_REVIEW.md)

## Hardening Measures

SaneBar implements:

- **Hardened Runtime** — Required for notarization
- **No network entitlements** — App cannot make network connections
- **Notarized by Apple** — Scanned for malware before distribution
- **Open source** — Full code available for inspection

---

## Privacy

SaneBar collects **zero** user data:

- No analytics
- No telemetry
- No crash reporting to external services
- No account required
