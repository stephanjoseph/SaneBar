This is a great start. Judging by the screenshots, **SaneBar** is a macOS menu bar utility that focuses on minimalism, privacy, and automation. It competes in a space with established players (like Bartender, Ice, Hidden Bar), so your marketing needs to highlight what makes it distinct: **Privacy (Touch ID)**, **Automation (AppleScript)**, and **Simplicity ("Sane")**.

Here is my strategic plan for your GitHub and Website as your interim Head of Marketing & Design.

### ---

**1\. The GitHub Strategy (The "Trust" Hub)**

Since this is a system utility, users need to trust that it isn't stealing data. Your GitHub is your credibility badge.

Repo Name: stephanjoseph/SaneBar  
Description: "The privacy-first menu bar manager for macOS. Native, lightweight, and scriptable."

#### **The README.md Structure**

Don't just dump code here. Treat the README as a landing page for developers and power users.

* **Header:**  
  * **Logo:** The icon from the "About" screen.  
  * **Badges:** \[macOS 14+\] \[Swift\] \[Privacy: 100% On-Device\]  
* **The "Hook" (Hero Image):** Use **Screenshot 2026-01-09 at 3.41.33 PM.jpg** (The "Find Hidden Icon" search UI). It looks the most technical and impressive.  
* **Key Features (Bulleted List):**  
  * **🔒 Secure Reveal:** The *only* menu bar manager that locks your hidden icons behind **Touch ID** or Password (highlight this from Screenshot 3.41.50 PM).  
  * **⚡️ Power Search:** Instantly find and activate any menu bar item with keyboard shortcuts.  
  * **🤖 Automation Ready:** extensive AppleScript support for shortcuts and workflow integration (highlight Screenshot 3.41.40 PM).  
  * **🔋 Context Aware:** Auto-show icons on low battery or specific WiFi networks.  
* **Privacy Pledge:**  
  * Include the content from the "About" screen: *"No analytics. No telemetry. No network requests."* This is a massive selling point against competitors who have recently faced privacy backlashes.  
* **Installation:**  
  * brew install \--cask sanebar (If you haven't submitted to Homebrew yet, do it immediately. It is essential for this target market).  
* **Issues/Roadmap:**  
  * Keep a pinned issue of "Coming Soon" features to show the project is alive.

**2\. SaneBar.com (The "Product" Face)**

The website needs to be sleek, dark-mode native, and minimalist. It should feel like an extension of macOS.

**Visual Style:** Use the deep purple/navy gradients visible in the background of your screenshots to maintain brand consistency.

#### **Hero Section (Above the Fold)**

* **Headline:** "Bring Sanity to your Menu Bar."  
* **Sub-headline:** "The advanced menu bar manager that combines minimalism with privacy. Hide the clutter, secure the rest."  
* **Call to Action (CTA):** \[Download for macOS\] (Secondary button: \[View on GitHub\])  
* **Visual:** An animated loop.  
  * *Start:* A cluttered menu bar.  
  * *Action:* Mouse hovers over the top, icons slide away (using the "SaneBar" pill graphic from your screenshots).  
  * *End:* A clean desktop.

#### **Feature Section 1: The "Privacy" Differentiator**

* *Use Screenshot: 3.41.50 PM (Privacy Settings)*  
* **Copy:** **"Your icons, for your eyes only."**  
* **Detail:** "Most menu bar hiders just tuck icons away. SaneBar locks them. Require Touch ID or your password to reveal sensitive apps like crypto wallets or messaging tools."

#### **Feature Section 2: The "Power User" Angle**

* *Use Screenshot: 3.41.40 PM (Shortcuts/Automation)*  
* **Copy:** **"Scriptable and snappy."**  
* **Detail:** "Control your menu bar with global hotkeys, gestures, or AppleScript. Build SaneBar into your Focus Modes and automation workflows."

#### **Feature Section 3: The "Context" Angle**

* *Use Screenshot: 3.41.23 PM (General/Auto-hide)*  
* **Copy:** **"There when you need it. Gone when you don't."**  
* **Detail:** "Configure SaneBar to reveal icons automatically when your battery is low, when you launch specific apps, or when you connect to a new WiFi network."

#### **Footer**

* "Made with 0% Analytics. 100% On-Device."  
* Links: GitHub, Contact, Press Kit.

**3\. Design & Marketing Tweaks (Quick Wins)**

* **The Icon:** The icon on the "About" screen (Screenshot 3.41.56 PM) is clean (the three lines/hamburger menu style). Ensure this is used consistently as the favicon on the site and the profile pic on GitHub.  
* **The "SaneBar" Pill UI:** In your screenshots, there is a glowing blue visual representation of the bar on the right side.  
  * *Recommendation:* Use this visual element as a separator on your website between sections. It’s your visual identity.  
* **Social Proof:** Since you are version 1.0.1, you might not have press quotes yet.  
  * *Action:* Post this on **Product Hunt** and **Hacker News** specifically highlighting the **Touch ID privacy feature**. That is your "viral" hook.

**Summary:** Your strongest asset is the "Privacy/Touch ID" feature. No other major competitor leads with that. Make that the headline on GitHub and Sanebar.com.
