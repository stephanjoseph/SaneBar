## 1. 9to5Mac Indie App Spotlight

**To:** michaelb@9to5mac.com
**Subject:** SaneBar - Privacy-first menu bar manager (open source, macOS 15+)

Hi Michael,

I built SaneBar after the Bartender acquisition raised trust concerns in 2024. It's a menu bar manager that actually respects your privacy.

**What makes it different:**
- 100% on-device — zero network requests, no analytics, no account
- Secure Reveal — lock hidden icons behind Touch ID/password (first menu bar app to do this)
- Find Hidden Icon — search and click any menu bar app, even ones hidden behind the Notch
- Open source on GitHub, MIT licensed

It's free, works on macOS 15 Sequoia and the upcoming Tahoe with Liquid Glass support, and was built pair-programming with Claude AI.

- Download: `brew install --cask stephanjoseph/sanebar/sanebar`

Happy to provide screenshots, promo codes, or answer any questions.

Best,
Stephan

## 5. Podcast Pitch (Generic Template)

**Subject:** Guest pitch: Building a privacy-first Mac app with AI pair programming

Hi [Name],

I'm an indie developer who built SaneBar, a macOS menu bar manager, entirely through pair programming with Claude AI. The app emerged after the Bartender acquisition raised privacy concerns in the Mac community.

**Potential topics:**
- AI-assisted development: What actually works (and what doesn't) when coding with LLMs
- Building trust through transparency: Why I went open source and zero-network
- The macOS indie scene: Competing with established apps on a $0 marketing budget
- Technical deep-dive: Working with Apple's Accessibility APIs

SaneBar has [X] GitHub stars and has been featured on [MacMenuBar / wherever]. Happy to share more or answer questions about the AI development angle.

Best,
Stephan

## 6. Under the Radar / Core Intuition Pitch

**Subject:** Indie story: Privacy-focused Bartender alternative built with Claude AI

Hi Marco and David / Daniel and Manton,

I built SaneBar, a macOS menu bar manager, after the Bartender acquisition made me uncomfortable with their new ownership's data practices.

The twist: I built the entire thing pair-programming with Claude. 241 unit tests, SwiftUI, Accessibility APIs, the works.

**The story:**
- Why I went 100% on-device (zero network requests, ever)
- The Bartender controversy and the market gap it created
- What it's like shipping a real Mac app built with AI assistance
- Lessons from working with Apple's Accessibility APIs (brutal)

Would love to share more if you're interested in the indie/privacy angle or the AI development story.
