### Power Search

### Automation Ready

![Shortcuts and Automation](marketing/shortcuts-automation.png)

### Core
- **One-click hide/show** — Toggle visibility with a single click or hotkey (default: ⌘\\)
- **⌘+drag to organize** — Choose which icons hide and which stay visible
- **Auto-hide** — Icons disappear after a configurable delay

### Gestures
- **Hover to reveal** — Move your cursor to the top of the screen to show hidden icons
- **Scroll to reveal** — Two-finger scroll up in the menu bar area

### Customization
- **Liquid Glass** — Beautiful translucent styling on macOS 26 Tahoe

Works perfectly on Macs with Notch. **100% private** — no network requests, no analytics, no account.

## Power User Features

### 🔍 Find Hidden Icon
Quickly find and activate any menu bar app without lifting your hands from the keyboard.
1. **Option-click** the SaneBar icon, or use the menu **Find Icon…** (default hotkey: ⌘⇧Space)
2. Type an app name and press **Return**
3. SaneBar will reveal hidden icons and **virtually click** the app's menu bar item
4. After 5 seconds, icons automatically hide again

This works even if the icon is physically hidden behind the Notch or off-screen!

### ⌨️ Per-Icon Hotkeys
Assign a specific global hotkey to any menu bar app.
1. Open **Find Icon…** window
2. Select an app from the list
3. Click the **Record Shortcut** box in the footer
4. Press your desired key combination
5. Now, pressing that hotkey will instantly show hidden items and open that app's menu

### 🎨 Bar Styling
Customize the look of your menu bar panel.
- Go to **Settings → Advanced → Appearance**
- Enable "Custom menu bar style"
- On macOS 26 Tahoe: Enable **Liquid Glass** for the native translucent look
- On older macOS: Adjust **Tint**, **Opacity**, **Shadow**, **Border**, and **Corner Radius**

### 💾 Profiles
Save different menu bar configurations for different contexts (e.g., "Work", "Gaming", "Presentation").
- Go to **Settings → Advanced → Profiles**
- Click **Save Current Settings as Profile…**
- Restore any profile with a single click

## The Notch & 50+ Apps

**Worried about losing icons behind the Notch?**

If you have 50+ apps, macOS might hide some of them behind the camera housing (the "Notch") or off-screen. SaneBar handles this gracefully:

1. **Hiding**: SaneBar pushes unused icons safely off-screen so your menu bar looks clean
2. **Safety Lock**: If SaneBar itself would get pushed off-screen, it refuses to hide to ensure you never lose control
3. **Find Hidden Icon**: Can't see an icon because it's behind the Notch? Open **Find Icon…**, type the app name and hit Enter. SaneBar will find it and click it for you, even if it's invisible

## Configuration

All settings are in the **Settings** window (click SaneBar icon → Settings, or press ⌘,).

| Tab | What's there |
|-----|--------------|
| **General** | Launch at login, auto-hide delay, gesture triggers |
| **Shortcuts** | Global keyboard shortcuts, AppleScript commands |
| **Advanced** | Profiles, always-visible apps, triggers, appearance |
| **About** | Version info, privacy badge, licenses |

### Gesture Triggers (Settings → General)
- **Hover near top** — Show hidden icons when you move cursor to the top of the screen
- **Scroll up** — Two-finger scroll up in the menu bar reveals hidden icons

### Smart Triggers (Settings → Advanced → Automation)
- **Low Battery** — Auto-show when battery drops below threshold
- **App Launch** — Show when specific apps start (enter bundle IDs)
- **WiFi Networks** — Show on specific networks (enter SSIDs or click "Add current network")

Built pair programming with [Claude](https://claude.ai). Wanted a menu bar manager that wasn't $15, didn't phone home, and actually worked on macOS Tahoe with Liquid Glass.
